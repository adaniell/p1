<h3>In 2+ sentences describe who you are and what you do.</h3>
<p>My name is Ashley Daniell and I am from Medford, MA. I graduted in 2012 from the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth with a BA in Crime &amp; Justice Studies. I've always been interested in computers and technology, and I sometimes regret that I didn't major in something like Computer Science. But now I have a wonderful job as a web developer/technologist at Harvard Business School. I first started just copying and pasting content 4 years ago on an Intranet migration project, which then triggered my interest in web development. </p>

<h3>Why are you taking this course?</h3>
<p>I am taking this course to further expand my web development skills, learn how dynamic applications work, and to be able to understand and build a page with personilzation. I am also working towards completing the requirements for the Professional Graduate Web Technologies Certificate.</p>

<h3>What previous experience do you have with programming?</h3>
<p>Not that much, I would consider myself a beginner. I know the fundamentals of Javascript and some XSLT but have been mostly working with HTML &amp CSS. </p>

<h3>Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?</h3>
<p>I am working on a PC with Windows 7. I use a Mac at work for testing purposes and I found that I prefer the PC.</p>

<h3>Anything else we should know?</h3>

<p>I am at the point in my life where I really want to buckle down and focus on Web Development as my career. This class will take me one step closer and I'm very excited about it. Although I love my position at HBS, I am currently contracting under my own LLC, and I'm hoping the Certificate will help me get a full time position.</p>
<p>I recently received an "In Recognition" Award recommended by my Director at work, for the last project I was on. It was a re-design of Professor Michael Porter's HBS website, which was an ugly static site for many many years. I was dedicated to this project for about 8 months, so it felt amazing to be recognized for all of the hard work I put into it. <br/>Check it out! <a href="http://www.isc.hbs.edu" target="_blank"> Institute for Strategy &amp; Competitiveness</a>   </p>
