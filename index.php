<h3>In 2+ sentences describe who you are and what you do.</h3>
<p>My name is Ashley Daniell and I am from Medford, MA. I graduted in 2012 from the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth with a BA in Crime &amp; Justice studies. I've always been interested in computer technology, and I sometimes regret that I didn't major in it. But now I have a great job as a web developer at Harvard Business School, where I first started just copying and pasting content 4 years ago. </p>
<h3>Why are you taking this course?</h3>
<p>I am taking this course to further expand my web development skills, as well to complete the requirements for the Web Technologies Certificate.</p>
<h3>What previous experience do you have with programming?</h3>
<p>Not that much, I would consider myself a beginner. I know the basics of Javascript but have been mostly working with html/css and xslt. 
<h3>Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?</h3>
<p>I am working on a PC with Windows 7. I use Mac's at work sometimes but I prefer the PC.</p>
<h3>Anything else we should know?</h3>
